couraged as a salesman that-he was thinking of going 
back to work with his hands in a:mathine’shép, when 
oye day he received a lefter inviting him to,an organi- 
zation meeting of the Dale Carnegie Course'ih Effective 
Speaking. : -* 

_ He didn’t want to attend.”He feared he would have 
to associate vith a lot of college’men, that he wou!d be 
out of place. 

His despairing wife insisted that he go, saying, “It 
may do you some good, Pat. God knows you need it. 
He went down to the place where the meeting was to be 
held and gtood on the sidewalk for five minutes betore 
he could.generate enough self-confidence to eater the 
room. ° 


The first few times he tried to speak, he was dizzy 
with fear. As the weeks drifted by, he lost all fear of 
audiences and soon found that he loved to talk—the 
bigger the crowd, the better. And he also lost hig fear 
of individuals. Ele lost his fear of his own customers. 
His income mounted and skyrocketed. Today he 1s one 
of the star salesmen in New York City. That night at 
the Pennsylvania Hotel, Patrick O'Haire stood in 
front of two thousand five hundred people and told a 
gay, rollicking story of his achievements. Wave after 
wave of laughter swept over the audience. Few pro- 

fessional speakérs could have equalled his performanse. } 


The next speaker, Godfrey Meyer, was a gray- 
headed banker, the father of eleven children. The first 
‘time he attempted to speak in class, ht&was literally

is a vivid illustration of how Jeadership gravitates to.
